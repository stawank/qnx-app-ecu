## Overview
Work in Progress...!
Describe:
- Work in Progress
- What the project does
- Why it exists
- How it fits into the overall QNX system (e.g., startup service, user-space daemon, resource manager)
- Each process runs independently and failures are isolated.

Example:
> This project implements a QNX Neutrino resource manager for controlling XYZ hardware over SPI.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System:** QNX Neutrino RTOS (e.g., 7.1, SDP 8.0)
- **Toolchain:** QNX Momentics / qcc
- **Host OS:** Linux Ubuntu 22.04LTS
- **Dependencies:**
  - libc
  - pthread
  - specific QNX libraries
  - to be added.

## Target Platform

- **CPU Architecture:** ARMv8
- **Board / SoC:** Raspberry Pi 4b
- **Peripherals Used:** None
- **Endianness:** Little

## Architecture
Work in Progress...!

High-level description of the design.

- Process model (single process, multi-process)
- IPC mechanisms (e.g., message passing, pulses, shared memory)
- Threading model
- Interaction with other QNX services
